# Chapter 1

Object oriented analysis (OOA)
```
is about what needs to be done. the output here is the description of the system in requirements form.
```
Object oriented design (OOD) 
```
turns the requirements into impelementation specification (set of classes and interfaces). 
```
Object orientd programming (OOP)
```
Converting the design into working program.

Class vs Object
```
- Classes
Discribe related objects, they are like a blueprint for creating ab object.

- Object
Collection of data with associated behaviors.
```

```
UML is good if you want remember the project details with out forget any aspect/information from the team meeting.
```

```
Data members / attributes / instance variable
represents an indvidual characteristics of a certain object.
```

```
OOA and OOD are about fiuring out what those objects are and how they should interact.
```

```
Abstraction is another object-oriented term related to encapsulation and information hiding. Abstraction means dealing with the level of detail that is most appropriate to a given task. It is the process of extracting a public interface from the inner details.


abstraction is the process of encapsulating information with a separate public interface.
```

```
Composition is the act of collecting several objects together to create a new one.

Aggregation is almost exactly like composition. The difference is that aggregate
objects can exist independently.


Aggregation and Composition are subsets of association meaning they are specific cases of association. In both aggregation and composition object of one class "owns" object of another class. But there is a subtle difference:

Aggregation implies a relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent. Example: Class (parent) and Student (child). Delete the Class and the Students still exist.
Composition implies a relationship where the child cannot exist independent of the parent. Example: House (parent) and Room (child). Rooms don't exist separate to a House.
